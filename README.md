VIP Training Days Developer Fundamentals II VM
====================

Hey, welcome to the VIP Training Days Virtual Machine

Purpose
-------

The goal of this VM is to simplify and standardize the setup across all
attendees and speakers.

No more last-minute permissions debugging or people, who didn't bother
to install web server, MySQL, memcached and a several more pieces of
software needed for the presentations.

Vagrant
-------

This VM is maintained using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).
vagrant is a tool, which helps create, configure, and replicate virtual
machines.

How to Install
--------------

0. Install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/), preferably the
   latest 1.5 version. Less than 1.1 will not work.
1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Check out `https://github.com/158e6ce7b351/vip-training-days-vm
3. Run `vagrant up`.
4. Wait :-)
5. Map `10.86.73.82` to `vip-training-days.dev` in your hosts file or in your local
   DNS server.
6. You can now open `http://vip-training-days.dev/` or run `vagrant ssh`

How Does It Work
----------------

Every time the VM is provisioned (on boot or `vagrant reload`, not on
`vagrant resume`), we run Puppet. It installs or updates the
neededs software, copies files to their right places, restarts the
services with the proper configs.

Conventions
-------------------------------------------

* Use `http://vip-training-days.dev/talk-slug` as the URL of your demo sites
* Whenever you need to choose a username and a password, choose
  `wordpress`/`wordpress`.
